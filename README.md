# StockPriceForecasting
 Forecasting stock prices has become a hot topic with the advent of more efficient and precise machine learning methods. To overcome the shortcomings of traditional time series models for estimating stock prices, I investigate and compare two of such as machine learning approaches: ridge regression and LeastAbsolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression.
 
 In this project, I provide reproducible in the R Markdown file StockPriceForecasting.Rmd which produces the pdf file StockPriceForecasting.pdf when the R Markdown filed is knitted. Note that, this project is soley for pedagogical purposes and should not be miscontrued as an accurate prediction of any stock price.
